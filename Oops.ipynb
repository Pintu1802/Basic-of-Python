    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., a class. The internal representation and behavior of the class are hidden from the outside world, and access to the data is controlled through methods. This helps in achieving data abstraction and data hiding, promoting better code organization and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex real-world problems into a model that includes only relevant attributes and behavior. In OOP, abstraction allows you to create abstract classes with method declarations but no implementations, and concrete classes that implement those methods. This separation of interface from implementation allows developers to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class (called the subclass or derived class) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (called the superclass or base class). The subclass can extend or override the functionality of the superclass, and it can also add new attributes and methods. Inheritance facilitates code reuse, making the code more manageable and promoting the concept of a hierarchical class structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and reusability in code. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (same method name with different parameters) and method overriding (same method name with different implementations in the superclass and subclass)."
